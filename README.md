# CS250
Artifacts and retrospective for SNHU CS-250

Portfolio Reflection

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs starts with listening. Whether that’s through stakeholder input, user interviews, or reviewing goals. Creating clear user stories transforms those needs into something actionable. Each story gives context and outlines what "done" looks like from the user's perspective. By working with user stories, I’ve learned to think beyond features and focus on user value, which keeps the development grounded in real world usage.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development in iterations. Starting small, building fast, and testing frequently. Agile processes like sprint planning and retrospectives help me stay on track and constantly improve. Going forward, I want to keep using tools like user stories and retrospectives to not only organize work but also improve how I collaborate with others. Even when I’m working solo, treating development as an evolving process helps me write better, more sustainable code.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, to give and take feedback with respect, and to care about the team’s success just as much as their own. Throughout this course, I played multiple roles, from developer to tester to Product Owner, and saw how smooth things go when people clarify expectations early and pitch in where they’re needed. Flexibility and accountability are among what I’ve come to value most in team dynamics.
